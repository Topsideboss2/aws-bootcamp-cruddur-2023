# Types of Architecture Diagrams
## 1. Conceptual Architecture Diagram

A Conceptual Architecture Diagram is also known as a "Napkin Design". The main objective of this architecture diagram is to highlight the relationship between key components and is often workflow oriented.

## 3. Physical Architecture Diagram

This is a very detail oriented architecture diagram that depicts physical elements that enable the infrastructure team to do their work including server models, databases, network, zones, systems, subsystems and connectivity. It is often very detail oriented and will not be readily understandable by business users but familiar to developers.
